  As a person interested in the growth of AgileVentures
  In order to get developers excited about being involved in a project
  I would like the project to include some cool new tech like websockets and phoenix/elixir
  
  As a person who is interested in Championer
  So that I can interact easily with other Championer stakeholders
  I would like to access a Championer chat
