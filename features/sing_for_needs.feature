## Federico's Notes on Sing For Needs

> I have an idea to create a platform/program potentially called _Sing for Needs_. Not having the “client” up front, there would be work to develop a prototype where an app/site is developed that allows anyone lacking means around the world to perform, record, and upload a performance of music (or singing performance). Donors could then view the performance and be moved to give in the form of a list of needs or monetary donations. It would be an uplifting approach to giving, as opposed to a guilt-based or sadness-enducing approach. The receiver of the donation wouldn’t have to be the performer either. So initiated from within Championer to help the needy directly, would be the directive.
