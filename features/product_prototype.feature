Notes generated from discussing above
-------------------------------------

User comes to website or app, and they would see a link to all the different products/prototypes that are being worked on, and information about who and what Championer is e.g. a video or something explaining how it works.

At the core Championer is about trying to push out products, so it might be more geared towards developers as well.

Holding company for products/prototypes - 

marketed more directly at a person who needs a product or prototype

Stakeholders:

*) Developers (volunteers/paid-staff? who might contribute to different products/prototypes, and having ideas for products/prototypes)
*) Philanthropist


As a member of the public (or a potential or current user of the product)
So that I can find out about the organisation championer that created a cool product/prototype
I want to have access to a website with information about Championer
