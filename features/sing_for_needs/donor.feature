Feature: Donor

  As a potential donor
  So that I can see a range of deserving causes and be inspired to contribute to them
  I would like to watch/listen to performances from talented folks advocating for particular causes, and then contribute
  
  Scenario: Browse performances and see associated causes (browse causes)
  
  Scenario: See more details on particular causes
  
  Scenario: See the actual performance, work of art
  
  Scenario: Make a donation (e.g. via paypal, stripe etc.)
  
  Scenario: Sign up for notification when new performances are available for a particular cause, or from a particular artist
  
  # sign in/sign up comes at last possible moment
